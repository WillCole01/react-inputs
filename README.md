# react-inputs
Created with CodeSandbox

## How to start the application and server?
in the command line:
    cd into the react-inputs folder
    run the following command: npm run dev

# How it works?
checking the package.json, there is a client and server command
dev ensures that both the client and server start at the same time, with the use of concurrently (npm package)
